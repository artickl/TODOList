1) Telegram - youtube integration

	sending youtube link to telegram and receiving mp3 back

2) Roomba API verification and automatization 

	Info: need to clean up room on weekends not on a schedule, but when I leave home... such as:
		or when my phone is not connected to my wifi (for 10 min for example once a day) - benefit: can be done locally via checking who is online in WiFi network
		or when my phone is connected to my car - issue: should be run on a phone

3) Wyze API verification and automatization

	Info: enable motion detection when I left home
		same as Roomba, but daily...

4) verify IFTTT functional

	Info:
		Roomba when I left home is not working
		Wyze - enable detection when I left home is not working either
